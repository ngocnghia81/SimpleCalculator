!3 Welcome to the Calculator FitNesse Test Suite

This test suite demonstrates the use of FitNesse for testing a simple Calculator application.

!4 Test Standards

1. All test tables should use the !| syntax consistently
2. Use "first number", "second number" naming convention for input fields 
3. All paths should be relative (e.g., target/classes) rather than absolute paths
4. Intentional test failures should be clearly documented with comments
